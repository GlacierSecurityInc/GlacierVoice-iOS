# Assistant configuration

The assistant allows to create a new sip account on a pre-defined SIP service using an xml-rpc connection,
as well as configuring an existing SIP account.
The files Resources/assistant_linphone_create.rc and Resources/assistant_linphone_existing.rc contain the
information necessary to create and configure the SIP accounts, most notabily:
	* proxy_default_values/reg_identity to define the SIP identity
	* sip/rls_uri to define the SIP URI of the presence server
	* assistant/domain to specify the SIP domain
	* assistant/xmlrpc_url to specify the https url of the account creation service

# In-app purchase configuration

The Resources/linphonerc.factory, section [in_app_purchase] is the entry point for configuring
the in-app purchases available in the application, as well as parameters for account expiry notifications.
Refer to the inlined comments in this configuration for description of all configurables.
